On the other, very few people can resist the temptation that a fantastic onion ring can bring. Just like mozzarella sticks, onion ringsâ€™ golden brown breadcrumb coating make them a star side at any restaurant or home.

                  <li>  <p>step 1</p>  <p>
                        Pair two slices of onion rings. 
                        One piece should be larger than the other and there should be a space in between the rings when the smaller piece is placed inside the larger one.
